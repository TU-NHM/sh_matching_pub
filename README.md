EOSC-Nordic service preparations (SH matching)

**NB! master branch is used as development branch. Please check out [Releases](https://github.com/TU-NHM/sh_matching_pub/releases) to download a specific version of the SH matching tool.**

Developed as part of [EOSC-Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) project (task 5.2.1: Cross-border data processing workflows), UNITE SH matching analysis is a digital service for the global species discovery from eDNA (environmental DNA). SH matching service is based on the [UNITE](https://unite.ut.ee) datasets hosted in [PlutoF](https://plutof.ut.ee). Its output includes information about what species are present in eDNA samples, are they potentially undescribed new species, where are they found in other studies, are they alien or threatened species, etc. The output will provide DOI (Digital Object Identifier) based stable identifiers for the communicating species found in eDNA. DOIs are connected to the taxonomic backbone of [PlutoF](https://plutof.ut.ee) and [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org). In this way every DOI is accompanied by a taxon name which is still widely used for the communication of species. In the case of undescribed species, DOIs will soon be issued by the [PlutoF](https://plutof.ut.ee) system (only if SH matching service integrated with the [PlutoF](https://plutof.ut.ee) platform is used for the analysis). SH matching service covers all Eukaryota by using rDNA ITS marker sequences accompanied by sample metadata.

The script expects input files in FASTA format. Outdata files are described in [sh_matching_analysis/readme.txt](https://github.com/TU-NHM/sh_matching_pub/blob/master/sh_matching_analysis/readme.txt).


## Setup

### Pre-requisites

* [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) - install Singularity (tested with version 3.5) and obtain API key for remote build

### Setup steps

1. Create Singularity Image File (SIF)
    ```console
    sudo singularity build sh_matching.sif sh_matching.def
    ```

2. OPTIONAL: Copy SIF to HPC
    ```console
    scp sh_matching.sif example_hpc_user@example.com:
    ```

3. Create input, output and working data directories
    ```console
    mkdir userdir
    mkdir indata
    mkdir outdata
    ```

## SH matching: running the analysis (OPTIONAL: This could be done through sbatch slurm scripts)

**NB! The script expects input files in FASTA format, named as source_[run_id] and placed in indata/ directory. Outdata files are described in [sh_matching_analysis/readme.txt](https://github.com/TU-NHM/sh_matching_pub/blob/master/sh_matching_analysis/readme.txt).**

4. Run the pipeline using SIF (example data with run_id=11, region=itsfull, and itsx_step=yes)
    ```console
    ./sh_matching.sif /sh_matching/run_pipeline.sh 11 itsfull yes
    ```
